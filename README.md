### About

Quantified self is a simple calorie tracking application. It is used as a learning experience in using multiple languages and seperating backend and frontend services. This is the Express.js component.

### Getting Started

This project uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework, which can be installed [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html).
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is used as the package manager for the app.

In order to run this appication in the development environment, perform the following in the CLI:

```
npm install
sequelize db:create
sequelize db:migrate
sequelize db:seed:all
```

In order to spin-up the server, run: `npm start`

The frontend component can be found at: [quantified-self-fe](https://github.com/anlewis/quantified-self-fe-express). Follow the instructions in the Readme to spin up a server locally.

This application is also in production. The base Heroku URI is (https://qs-express.herokuapp.com). In order to access the endpoints, use `/api/v1/ENDPOINT`.

Example: (https://qs-express.herokuapp.com/api/v1/foods.json)

### Learning Goals
- Create a [Rails API](https://github.com/anlewis/quantified-self-rails) given specified endpoints and response formats.
- Create an Express API given specified endpoints and response formats.
- Create an API in a new language of the students choice (chosen: [Java/Spring]()) given specified endpoints and response formats.
- Review and refactor code (in each of the three languages) so that it:
  - is well organized
  - clearly communicates intent
  - utilizes abstraction to hide complexity
  - breaks problems down into small methods/functions with a single responsibility

### Database

The following schema was used to create a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database:

### Testing

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/) were used for testing.

In order to run tests, perform the following:

`npm test`

### API Endpoints

Quantified Self will have the following endpoints:

#### Food Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/foods`: Returns all foods currently in the database

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Banana",
    "calories": 150
}
```

- `GET /api/v1/foods/:id` Returns the food object with the specific :id you’ve passed in or 404 if the food is not found.

- `POST /api/v1/foods` Allows creating a new food with the parameters:

```
{ "food": { "name": "Name of food here", "calories": "Calories here"} }
```

- `PATCH /api/v1/foods/:id` Allows one to update an existing food with the parameters:

```
{ "food": { "name": "Mint", "calories": "14"} }
```

- `DELETE /api/v1/foods/:id` Will delete the food with the id passed in and return a 204 status code. If the food can’t be found, a 404 will be returned.

        }
    ]
}
```

- `POST /api/v1/meals/:meal_id/foods/:id` Adds the food with :id to the meal with :meal_id. This returns:
